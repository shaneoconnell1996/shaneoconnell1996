### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shane O'Connell (he / him). I'm a 4th year PhD student in NUI Galway/MSSM studying computational neuroscience and genetics. I'm a member of the first cohort of the [Genomics Data Science Centre for Research Training](https://genomicsdatascience.ie/) and this is my Github page!  

#### Current work

Specifically, I am focused on interrograting brain structural changes associated with bipolar disorder. My work so far has focused on building convolutional neural networks and other predictive models that make use of T1-weighted MRI scans of patients and controls in an effort to understand the biology of the features used by the predictive models. I also work on MR of brain imaging phenotypes and autoencoders.

my email address is shane.connell96@gmail.com
