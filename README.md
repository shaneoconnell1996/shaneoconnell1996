### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Shane O'Connell (he / him). I'm a (nearly) 2nd year PhD student in NUI Galway studying computational neuroscience and genetics. I'm a member of the first cohort of the [Genomics Data Science Centre for Research Training](https://genomicsdatascience.ie/) and this is my Github page!  

#### Current work

Specifically, I am focused on interrograting brain structural changes associated with bipolar disorder. My work so far has focused on building convolutional neural networks and other predictive models that make use of T1-weighted MRI scans of patients and controls in an effort to understand the biology of the features used by the predictive models. I am still in the model building phase - who knew deep learning was so difficult!? 

#### Other work and interests

For my MSc thesis, I dabbled in using generative adversarial networks to model gene expression data. I was also involved in modelling protein-protein coexpression networks associated with strokes earlier in 2020. As part of my PhD commitments, I have delivered several tutorials including introductions to data vizualisation,  machine learning for life scientists, ChIP-Seq data analysis, variant calling, and an introduction to singularity containers. I have an interest in (most things) machine learning (classical and deep), statistical modelling, causal inference, and the genetics of neuropsychiatric disorders. 

Any queries or comments can be directed to my email address - shane.connell96@gmail.com. Thanks for reading! :octocat:
